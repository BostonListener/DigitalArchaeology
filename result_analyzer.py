Complete OpenAI Integration for Archaeological Detection Pipeline

This module provides comprehensive AI-powered analysis capabilities for the
archaeological detection pipeline. It integrates OpenAI's GPT models to:

1. Analyze surface features and archaeological patterns
2. Interpret deforestation contexts and NDVI vegetation anomalies  
3. Validate multi-source evidence for archaeological significance
4. Generate cultural context and historical research
5. Create comparative analyses with known archaeological sites
6. Support all checkpoint requirements for competition compliance

The module implements robust error handling, interaction logging, and
reproducibility features essential for scientific applications.

Key Features:
- Automated archaeological interpretation of remote sensing data
- Historical and cultural context generation
- Multi-source evidence synthesis
- Checkpoint compliance verification
- Comprehensive interaction logging for reproducibility

Usage:
    analyzer = OpenAIAnalyzer()
    result = analyzer.describe_surface_features(data_type, description, dataset_id)

Requirements:
    - OpenAI API key in environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY
    - Internet connection for API access
    - Valid pipeline configuration file
